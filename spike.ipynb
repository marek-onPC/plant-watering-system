    "# Plant watering system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an automated plant watering system to maintain optimal moisture levels in outoor plants during prolonged owner absences.\n",
    "Use easily available materials and devices for easiest developement and maintanance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Control: automated  (by microcontroller)\n",
    "- Water source: prefilled water tank/bucket\n",
    "- Power source: battery\n",
    "- Number of plants to care for: 6 of medium size, 8 of small size\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope:**\n",
    "1. Define the type of equipment needed.\n",
    "2. Select specific devices (e.g., models of microcontrollers).\n",
    "3. Define the device scheme (i.e., representation of physical implementation).\n",
    "4. Code the microcontroller.\n",
    "5. Test, evaluate, and implement corrections if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical small plant watering system would consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a control unit\n",
    "- a water pump\n",
    "- a power source\n",
    "- a water tank\n",
    "- wires and other electrical equipment\n",
    "- pipes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control unit\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary function of the control unit will be to regulate the water pump's operation according to a timer, with the option to later integrate additional sensors into the system. Furthermore, it should be compact, readily accessible, and supported by a robust IDE and community to facilitate smooth development. It should also be powered by an external power source like batteries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such job, an Arduino unit should be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "From different types of Arduino boards, it should be:\n",
    "- small size\n",
    "- little power consumption (comparision [here by Michael Klements](https://youtu.be/5cYN5-Spnos?si=_OcS8ThA6U6mcKVe))\n",
    "- easy-to-work-with environment\n",
    "- posibility of extending, adding new equipment\n",
    "- low cost\n",

    "Based on the data provided in articles and posts:\n",

    "### Wires and other electrical equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "Two ways of controling power supply:\n",
    "- Darlington transistor:\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the power supply of a water pump in an ON/OFF (true/false) manner, as suggested in [this](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/18447) comment, it should be feasible by directing power through a Darlington transistor.\n",
    "The specific transistor required depends on the chosen water pump, but either the TIP102/107 (datasheet [here](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/tip102.pdf)) or the TIP120/121/122 (datasheet [here](https://www.learn-c.com/tip120.pdf)) should suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relay\n",
    "A relay is a programmable electrical switch that can be controlled by an Arduino and, in turn, can control connected devices. It functions as a bridge between the Arduino and high-voltage equipment. More on relays [here](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-relay).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Water pump\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible water pumps to use:\n",
    "- [DC 12V water pump](https://item.rakuten.co.jp/funlifestore/org01772/)\n",
    "- [DC 3V water pump](https://item.rakuten.co.jp/robotshopjapan/rb-elf-325/) (pump with output-only hose connection)\n",

    "- [DC 4,5V water pump](https://item.rakuten.co.jp/sotenco/a21030500ux0314/) (pump with input-output hose connection)\n",
    "\n",
    "As Arduino provides only 5V directly, the scheme for 12V pumps will be more complicated, requiring a relay or a boost converter. 5V pumps can be powered directly, with a Darlington transistor used to control the state of the pump."
