    "# Plant watering system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an automated plant watering system to maintain optimal moisture levels in outoor plants during prolonged owner absences.\n",
    "Use easily available materials and devices for easiest developement and maintanance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Control: automated  (by microcontroller)\n",
    "- Water source: prefilled water tank/bucket\n",
    "- Power source: battery\n",
    "- Number of plants to care for: 6 of medium size, 8 of small size\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope:**\n",
    "1. Define the type of equipment needed.\n",
    "2. Select specific devices (e.g., models of microcontrollers).\n",
    "3. Define the device scheme (i.e., representation of physical implementation).\n",
    "4. Code the microcontroller.\n",
    "5. Test, evaluate, and implement corrections if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical small plant watering system would consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a control unit\n",
    "- a water pump\n",
    "- a power source\n",
    "- a water tank\n",
    "- pipes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control unit\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary function of the control unit will be to regulate the water pump's operation according to a timer, with the option to later integrate additional sensors into the system. Furthermore, it should be compact, readily accessible, and supported by a robust IDE and community to facilitate smooth development. It should also be powered by an external power source like batteries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such job, an Arduino unit should be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "From different types of Arduino boards, it should be:\n",
    "- small size\n",
    "- little power consumption (comparision [here by Michael Klements](https://youtu.be/5cYN5-Spnos?si=_OcS8ThA6U6mcKVe))\n",
    "- easy-to-work-with environment\n",
    "- posibility of extending, adding new equipment\n",
    "- low cost\n",
